    <!-- Create a function that takes the number of wins, draws and losses and calculates the number of points a football team has obtained so far.

- wins get 3 points
- draws get 1 point
- losses get 0 points
For Ex: footballPoints(3, 4, 2) âžž 13 -->
<script>
    function getCalculatedpoints(wins, draws, losses){
